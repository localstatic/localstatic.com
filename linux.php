		<dd>These pages document installs of several Linux distributions on my
		old Toshiba Satellite 2100CDT laptop. I don't use the machine anymore,
		but am keeping these pages online for those that need them. I still get
		the occasional email about them, so there is apparently some need
		still.</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="linux-nforce">Linux and nForce2</a></dt>
		<dd>Documents my success with Linux on the nForce2 chipset. I wrote
		this because when I was researching motherboards, all I was finding
		were problem reports with this chipset. I ended up getting one of the
		boards anyway, and have had no troubles whatsoever. This document is
		mainly intended to help ease the worries of anyone looking for such
		success stories with this chipset.</dd>
